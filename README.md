# Traffic Sign Recognition - Neural Network & SVM

## First Step: Get the Dataset
**Dataset Used:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign<br/>
If you can't download the dataset on your local pc, you can just download it in colab -><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/general/74235" target="blank"> Here </a>  You can find how.

<br/>

## Second Step: Work on Building and Trainign the Models
Go To File => [TrafficSignModel](TrafficSignModel) You will find the model is build using
- ANN
- CNN
- SVM


## Third Step: Build Simple GUI using NN Model
Go To File => [TrafficSignApp](TrafficSignApp) You find the GUI Implementation in [TrafficSignGUI.py](TrafficSignApp/TrafficSignGUI.py) File
To Run this application you need to install the dependencies first using `pip` like
- `numpy`
- `tkinter`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `pillow`
#### After that, you can run the [TrafficSignGUI.py](TrafficSignApp/TrafficSignGUI.py) File and use it like in [Demo](#demo).
